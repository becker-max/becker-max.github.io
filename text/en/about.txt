<h1>Hello! I am Max Becker. Application Manager, Student for Business IT, Data Analyst.</h1>

<p>Currently, I am attending the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to complete my bachelor’s degree in Business IT majoring in Data Science & Engineering.</p>

<h1>Why Data Science?</h1>
<p>
I always took great interest in data sciences. Since having my first experiences with IT, I have always ended up having tasks in data structures. Be it huge Excel sheets, databases, log files or the like. Due to these experiences, in every company I have ever worked in, I ended up doing analyses, maintenance, or management of such structures at macro or micro level of that company.
</p>

<p>
The final impulse that set my whish in pursuing data science on a deeper level in motion was the course BDLC (Big Data Lab Cluster) in the 4th semester. In that course I got to work with several Big Data technologies and could design the entire data life cycle for a project. Beginning with the ETL process with an API as data source, to feeding the data into the Hadoop framework (namely HDFS). With that setup I structured the information via pySpark with my own Python script and finally analysed and visualised it in Zeppelin.
</p>
<p>
After that I have taken several courses having everything about data science and business intelligence as a subject. Namely BIDS (Business Intelligence Decision Support), DAWA (Data Warehousing) and DASB (Data Science Basics) already in the last semester. Next semester I will attend the courses Machine Learning and Knowledge Based Decision Systems. In these courses alone, I was able to build up a broad knowledge of business intelligence and data science in theory and practice. I am therefore well versed in technologies such as R, Python, SSIS processes and mathematical analysis (such as clustering and k-Means analysis and the like) in practice and the philosophies around data science and business intelligence in theory.
</p>

<h1>Why me?</h1>
<p>
My modus operandi is to find order in chaos and using this structured information to make valuable analyses for optimized decision support.
</p>
<p>
I can say of myself that I am a very upbeat personality. I can make friends with anyone and have no reservations about approaching people. I am very determined and when I have set myself a goal, I work tirelessly to achieve it.
</p>
<p>
My discipline stems from my years of experience in powerlifting, where you must follow a training and nutrition plan to reach higher and higher numbers after each training cycle. What I like about this sport so much is the tangible measurement of the line taken. The measurement is very simple. Either you do the repetition with that weight - or not.
</p>
<p>
I like to apply this philosophy to daily life. I do not like to beat about the bush. Either the goals were achieved or not. And if not, the routines and habits are adjusted so that the goals are achieved next time.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year I have also joined a club and will be competing in this year's Swiss Powerlifting Championship.
</p>
<p>
As I am still in my bachelor’s programme for a year, I would have to have a 60-70% workload (with 1.5 days of school per week).
