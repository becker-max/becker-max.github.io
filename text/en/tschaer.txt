Max was a mentor, coach and at the same time a true friend for me during my years of study. Not only was I allowed to realise ideas together with him in various data science and project work, but I was also always able to rely on his extensive expertise. Due to his human nature and his ability to not only absorb requirements, but to pass them in the end, I see him as a valuable addition to any team that needs high quality software. Thank you for letting me get to know you!
